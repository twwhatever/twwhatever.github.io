<p>The standard advice when returning to an Anki deck after a long break is
  1. Create a filtered deck that contains cards that are recently due (say, within a week)
  2. Review remaining backlog little by little until all reviews are cleared</p>
<p>The idea is that (1) ensures that you don't continue to fall further behind.  Cards that reviewed close to their due date are also less likely to be forgotten.  I found this deck generally worked as advertised.  I continued to have pretty high accuracy on the reviews of old cards, and it made sure new cards were reviewed promptly.</p>
<p>The problem I had with (2) was that my accuracy had dropped to around 50%.  That meant while I was reviewing the remaining cards, I quickly added more cards to the <em>next</em> day's review.  That effectively kept me from making much progress.  Even on days when I had a free block to review cards, I'd limit myself to stopping after I'd missed 10 or so cards so that reviews for the next day didn't pile up.  If I missed a couple days, I often would have so many recently due cards that I wouldn't get to my backlog at all.</p>
<h1>Not sweating the lapses</h1>
<p>Recently I decided to change my settings for the deck so that answering "Again" just reduced the ease by 70% with no upper limit.  That means if I get a card wrong, it typically gets scheduled a few months later instead of the next day.  Furthermore, the due dates are spread out based on the card so I don't get a big spike of reviews on a single day.  I've been more motivated to use my occasional free periods to go through reviews, and if I skip a day I don't have a big pileup of cards that are recently due.  I've also found that my accuracy has gone up from around 50% to around 70%.  By getting through more cards I'm reviewing more material and getting to take advantage of redundancies.</p>
<h1>Going forward</h1>
<p>I'm about half-way through my backlog, and plan to keep these settings until I get through the backlog.  However, once I'm done with the backlog, I'm not sure I'll keep them.  I'm concerned that I'm not actually re-learning the lapsed cards.  That's the tradeoff I want for now, but once I get caught up I'll probably move things back to the default.</p>
