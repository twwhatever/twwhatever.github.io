# Pelican deployment with GitHub Actions

I originally decided to use Pelican for this blog because I wanted to get more
practice with Python. Now I don't really have that motivation, but I don't
really want to spend time switching.

I had Pelican set up on one of my personal laptops. I started using that laptop
less and less, and I'd forget exactly how to deploy. So there was a lot of
friction. I'd have ideas I wanted to write about, but I'd put them off until I
was using my laptop.

Recently that laptop finally died. And my *other* personal laptop died. So I got
a new personal laptop and started setting it up. I have quite a laptop from
work, but I feel more comfortable having my own computer. While I was waiting
for it to arrive, I started playing around with [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so I could get some things done on
my iPad.

There's actions to deploy Pelican blogs to GitHub Pages. I ended up using [this
one](https://github.com/bimbimprasetyoafif/pelican-simple). Now when I push to
my source branch, the blog automatically updates.

I wonder if that will make me more likely to post here. In theory, I can now
write from anywhere using the browser (or mobile app) and get the rush of
publishing whenever I'm satisfied with the content.
