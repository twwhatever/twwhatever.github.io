# Can we build the blog with GitHub Actions?

I wonder if that would make me more likely to post here.

Right now, I have a convoluted setup that requires me to get out an old laptop.

It looks like it's possible to trigger actions.  But maybe my requirements are too out of date:

```
          from setuptools import setup, Extension, Feature
      ImportError: cannot import name 'Feature' from 'setuptools'
```
