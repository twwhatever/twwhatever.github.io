# Can we build the blog with GitHub Actions?

I wonder if that would make me more likely to post here.

Right now, I have a convoluted setup that requires me to get out an old laptop.

It looks like it's possible to trigger actions. And I found a script that sets
up and runs Pelican without errors.

But does it deploy like I'm expecting?
