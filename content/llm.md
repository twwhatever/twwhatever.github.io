family had been asking about chatgpt in recent gatherings

putting my thoughts together

llm adjacent. ive worked with small language models. and a little bit with the team that puy meta ai on smart glasses

what do llms do?  trained on text completion. but cant just store every most likely completion. so they form shortcuts. these shortcuts are useful. othello example. allow them to respond usefully to new input. 

why are they useful?  generate text that follows multiple rules. examples besides programming?

what is the problem?  i dont like hallucination. that sounds like a disfinction. but llms aren't malfunctioning when they generate text. they have no specific understanding of true and false beyond what they encode while trying to perform well on the training data. companies like openai, Microsoft, etc will try to make them more accurate overr time. 

so llms are very good at generating text that "looks right". in cases where ita easy to go feom "looks right" to "is right", they are cery helpful. key property is being able to quickly verify correctness. 

programming happens to be a task where its pretty easy to verify that something is right. a somewhat experienced programmer can  often quicly fix something thats almost right. 

writing small amounts of text (a sentence or paragraph ) is similar.  assuming fluency, verifying whether text is correctly written is pretty fast. and minor mistakes easily corrected. the phenomenon that ots easier to proofread othera writing plays into the users advantage here i suspect

a more specific search engine. instead of searching for general terms, ask about the specific case. kotlin example was good. but is there a more accessible one? helpful for things i do sporadically. 

boilerplate. following a specific style. reduces friction

best examples tend to be making people more productive (especially as they require verification). personally find them best for getting simple projects done much more quickly rather than anything advanced. like search engines, they shine when you need to learn something generally well known that you personally don't know (or dont remember). thats terifdically useful, because we all have limited time to gain expertise in everything we do. my suggestion is to try chatgpt for "easy" things. see if it can help you do them faster. then try it for things that you know are possible, but dont quite know how to do them. is there an accessible example?  maybe draw a parallel with historical event or famous style.
