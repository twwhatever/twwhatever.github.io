# Anki settings after a long break

The standard advice when returning to an Anki deck after a long break is
  1. Create a filtered deck that contains cards that are recently due (say, within a week)
  2. Review remaining cards little by little until all reviews are cleared

The idea is that (1) ensures that you don't continue to fall further behind.  Cards that reviewed close to their due date are also less likely to be forgotten.

The problem I had with (2) was that my accuracy had dropped to around 50%.  That meant while I was reviewing the remaining cards, I quickly added more cards to the *next* day's review.  That effectively kept me from making much progress.  Even on days when I had a free block to review cards, I'd limit myself to stopping after I'd missed 10 or so cards so that reviews for the next day didn't pile up.  If I missed a couple days, I often would have so many recently due cards that I wouldn't get to my backlog at all.

Recently I decided to change my settings for the deck so that answering "Again" just reduced the ease by 70% with no upper limit.  That means if I get a card wrong, it typically gets scheduled a few months later instead of the next day.  Furthermore, the due dates are spread out based on the card so I don't get a big spike of reviews on a single day.  I've been more motivated to use my occasional free periods to go through reviews, and if I skip a day I don't have a big pileup of cards that are recently due.  I've also found that my accuracy has gone up from around 50% to around 70%.  By getting through more cards I'm reviewing more of the subject and getting to take advantage of redundancies.
