</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I recently ran in to a minor issue using gRPC in Python.  It turns out
that there are constraints on the .proto directory structure if you
want to build a Python package out of multiple .proto files.  This
constraint doesn't appear to affect the Maven or NuGet plugins, which
caused me to waste a bunch of time since I got those working first and
assumed that other language plugins would be the same.  The issue and solution are
described in detail in this
<a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/1491">GitHub issue</a>.
In the following, I'll go over an example that reproduces my initial
mistake and a fixed version.</p>
<p>The gRPC developers in the GitHub issue recommend keeping
all the protobuf definitions for a package in a single file.  In that
case, you won't have this problem at all.  However, the workaround
presented here is not onerous, especially if followed from the start.</p>
<p>For concreteness, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/twwhatever/demo-grpc-python">simple demo</a> that
illustrates both the incorrect and working structures.</p>
<p>The initial setup I had was the following directory structure</p>
<ul>
<li>proto/<ul>
<li>message.proto</li>
<li>service.proto</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>demo/<ul>
<li>demo.py</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With message.proto</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="na">syntax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;proto3&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">demo</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">message</span> <span class="nc">DemoMessage</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="na">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and service.proto</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="na">syntax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;proto3&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">demo</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">&quot;message.proto&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">service</span> <span class="n">DemoService</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">rpc</span> <span class="n">Function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DemoMessage</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">returns</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DemoMessage</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>My plan was to generate the Python bindings using the following
command in the demo directory via </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python -m grpc_tools.protoc \
    -I../proto-wrong/ \
    --python_out=twwhatever/demo \
    --grpc_python_out=twwhatever/demo \
    ../proto-wrong/*.proto
</pre></div>


<p>That command succeeded and generates the bindings as expected.  When I
tried to create a service, though, I got an error.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever.demo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">service_pb2_grpc</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever.demo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">message_pb2</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Demo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">service_pb2_grpc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DemoServiceServicer</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">Function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">message_pb2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DemoMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hi there!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">demo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Demo</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">demo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately, importing the definitions in service.proto doesn't
work because the generated code service_pb2_grpc.proto contains the statement</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">message_pb2</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">message__pb2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which doesn't work because message_pb2 is actually in the twwhatever.demo module.</p>
<p>There appear to be a couple workarounds:
<em> Keep all the protocol buffer definitions you need in a single file
</em> Mirror the directory structure of your protocol buffer definitions - in particular your import statements - with your target Python package</p>
<p>In this case, it meant setting up the repository like this</p>
<ul>
<li>proto/twwhatever/demo/<ul>
<li>message.proto</li>
<li>service.proto</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>demo/<ul>
<li>demo.py</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the import statement in service.proto to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">&quot;twwhatever/demo/message.proto&quot;</span> 
</pre></div>


<p>And invoking the command from the Python directory like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python -m grpc_tools.protoc \
    -I../proto/ \
    --python_out=. \
    --grpc_python_out=. \
    ../proto/twwhatever/demo/*.proto
</pre></div>


<p>That way I got a package twwhatever.demo and I could use</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever.demo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">service_pb2_grpc</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">twwhatever.demo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">message_pb2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It appears that the same strategy works if you add
additional submodule structure (e.g., twwhatever/demo/mypackage, etc.).</p>
<p>The takeaway seems to be to put all the protocol buffer definitions
for a project under the same directory structure, and possibly better
yet in the same .proto file.</p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Anki settings after a long break</h1>
<p>The standard advice when returning to an Anki deck after a long break is
  1. Create a filtered deck that contains cards that are recently due (say, within a week)
  2. Review remaining backlog little by little until all reviews are cleared</p>
<p>The idea is that (1) ensures that you don't continue to fall further behind.  Cards that reviewed close to their due date are also less likely to be forgotten.  I found this deck generally worked as advertised.  I continued to have pretty high accuracy on the reviews of old cards, and it made sure new cards were reviewed promptly.</p>
<p>The problem I had with (2) was that my accuracy had dropped to around 50%.  That meant while I was reviewing the remaining cards, I quickly added more cards to the <em>next</em> day's review.  That effectively kept me from making much progress.  Even on days when I had a free block to review cards, I'd limit myself to stopping after I'd missed 10 or so cards so that reviews for the next day didn't pile up.  If I missed a couple days, I often would have so many recently due cards that I wouldn't get to my backlog at all.</p>
<h1>Not sweating the lapses</h1>
<p>Recently I decided to change my settings for the deck so that answering "Again" just reduced the ease by 70% with no upper limit.  That means if I get a card wrong, it typically gets scheduled a few months later instead of the next day.  Furthermore, the due dates are spread out based on the card so I don't get a big spike of reviews on a single day.  I've been more motivated to use my occasional free periods to go through reviews, and if I skip a day I don't have a big pileup of cards that are recently due.  I've also found that my accuracy has gone up from around 50% to around 70%.  By getting through more cards I'm reviewing more material and getting to take advantage of redundancies.</p>
<h1>Going forward</h1>
<p>I'm about half-way through my backlog, and plan to keep these settings until I get through the backlog.  However, once I'm done with the backlog, I'm not sure I'll keep them.  I'm concerned that I'm not actually re-learning the lapsed cards.  That's the tradeoff I want for now, but once I get caught up I'll probably move things back to the default.</p>                </article>
